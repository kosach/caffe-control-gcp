# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to instantly receive information about object changes in Poster. For example, when a new item is added to the menu or a receipt is processed.

## Connection

1. Go to your developer account â†’ Application Settings
2. In the Webhooks block, select the entities for which you want to receive hooks and the URL to send hooks to
3. Connect your application in the account for which you need to receive hooks
4. Edit, delete, or create an entity to trigger sending a hook.

For example, to send a hook for orders, subscribe to the transaction entity and close an order at the cash register.

## Webhook Parameters

Example of an incoming webhook:

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "64a7db37bc9daca9701a6f25"
  },
  "account": "mykava6",
  "object": "transaction",
  "object_id": 16776,
  "action": "changed",
  "time": "1688722229",
  "verify": "f6a209fccb87d7051d49bf3342c656ab",
  "account_number": "333226",
  "data": "{\"transactions_history\":{\"type_history\":\"additem\",\"time\":1688722229115,\"value\":483,\"value2\":78,\"value3\":429,\"value4\":0,\"value5\":null,\"value_text\":\"{\\\"price\\\":50,\\\"unit\\\":\\\"p\\\",\\\"nodiscount\\\":0,\\\"tax\\\":{\\\"id\\\":9,\\\"value\\\":0,\\\"type\\\":3,\\\"fiscal\\\":1},\\\"modificationData\\\":[{\\\"m\\\":21,\\\"a\\\":1}]}\",\"user_id\":6,\"spot_tablet_id\":1}}"
}
```

Example of webhook processing:

```php
<?php
// Your application's secret key
$client_secret = 'fe2bc8e865d8fc2236968ee53c3b2bd5';

// Convert incoming data to the required format
$postJSON = file_get_contents('php://input');
$postData = json_decode($postJSON, true);

$verify_original = $postData['verify'];
unset($postData['verify']);

$verify = [
    $postData['account'],
    $postData['object'],
    $postData['object_id'],
    $postData['action'],
];

// If there are additional parameters
if (isset($postData['data'])) {
    $verify[] = $postData['data'];
}
$verify[] = $postData['time'];
$verify[] = $client_secret;

// Create a string for client request verification
$verify = md5(implode(';', $verify));

// Verify data validity
if ($verify != $verify_original) {
    exit;
}

// If you don't respond to the request, Poster will continue sending the Webhook
echo json_encode(['status' => 'accept']);
```

## Webhooks Not Coming?

- Does the URL you specified in "URL for webhooks" respond with a 200 status code and accept POST requests?
- When checking in Poster for Developments, does a green checkmark appear?
- Are you subscribed to events for the entities you're modifying?
- Try simulating a hook send. To do this, edit the entity in Poster for which you're expecting a hook.
- Check if your application is connected to the account from which you're expecting hooks.
- If you didn't respond to previous hooks with a 200 status code, accept the previous ones and new ones will start arriving afterward.
- If you can't accept old hooks, remove all entities from "Receive webhooks by", save, and add them again.
